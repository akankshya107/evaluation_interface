#### Task Description
In this task, you will be presented with a short story, along with a summary of the story. Please read both the story and the summary carefully. We will then ask you to answer several questions that attempt to assess the quality of the summary. 


We will also include an AI-generated inconsistency of the summary with respect to the story, which **may or may not be correct**. You can choose to see this AI-generated inconsistency and use it help you answer the questions after you answer the first one.

**Warning:** Some of the stories may contain content that readers could find offensive, disturbing, or otherwise unsettling. If you do not feel comfortable with this, please feel free to decline the task.

If you encounter any problems or have other feedback, please contact columbia.nlp@outlook.com

#### Detailed Instructions with Example
Please read the story carefully and try to understand the points that are central to the plot. 

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

&nbsp;

Below are four example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

**Summary C**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad at half-past six outside a hospital. It's been raining hard and there are pools of water in the courtyard.

**Summary D**
>The rain has been pouring heavily, which has led to the hospital shutters being nailed shut. The rainwater has been collecting into pools in the hospital courtyard.

**Question 1: Is the information in the summary consistent with the story?**\
The first question asks you to judge whether or not the summary is consistent with the original story. In this case, you want to make sure the events and details described in the summary are mentioned in the actual story. For example, *Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story as the minister was sitting in the puddle of water and not lying in it. Note that *Summary A* is consistent with the story. The last bold sentence in *Summary A* contains some commentary on the story, and we ask you to ignore commentary in evaluating consistency. *Summary C* and *Summary D* are also consistent with the story. The AI-generated inconsistency 

If you need to see the AI-generated inconsistency to help you answer the above question, you can click and expand the section. This would be provided for every story and summary and would contain at least one potentially inconsistent detail identified between the summary and the story.

**Possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in summary B**
>Inconsistency: One of the ministers ... is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

>Reason for inconsistency: The story states that the minister who was too weak to stand was sitting down in the puddle of water with his head on his knees versus lying in it. Thus, the summary is inconsistent in this detail with respect to the story.

>Reason for consistency: The summary talks about the minister lying in a puddle of water. The story also mentions a sick minister who is in a puddle of water when the first shots are fired.

**Possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in summary D**
>Inconsistency: The rainwater has been collecting into pools in the hospital courtyard. 

>Reason for inconsistency: The story describes pools of water in the courtyard. However, it does not specify that these pools of water are from rainwater. Thus, the summary is inconsistent in this detail with respect to the story.

>Reason for consistency: The story mentions the pools of water in the courtyard. It also details that it is raining hard, which is clearly the source of the pools of water.

**Question 1 (repeated): Is the information in the summary consistent with the story?**\
The first question is repeated here. It still asks you to judge whether or not the summary is consistent with the original story. You can use the information in the *possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in the summary* to help answer this question. **Please note that this AI-generated inconsistency could be inaccurate or unhelpful, so please use your judgment to best answer the question.** For example, *Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story and the AI-generated inconsistency for Summary B states the correct inconsistency. Note that *Summary A* is consistent with the story. This may help you identify the fact that this summary is inconsistent, which could have been missed when answering this question in the first try. Please **resubmit** your answer instead of changing your earlier response. *Summary C* and *Summary D* are also consistent with the story. The AI-generated inconsistency for Summary D states an incorrect inconsistency, which is a misinterpretation of the facts in the story.

**Question 2: Is the possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in the summary correct?**\
The additional information in the *possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in the summary* can contain a correct analysis of the summary with respect to the story, or contain an incorrect, or invented inconsistency. This question asks you to judge whether this AI-generated inconsistency is correct. For example, *Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story and the inconsistency outlined in the additional section is correct. In such cases, this question can be marked **Yes**. However, for *Summary D*, the summary is consistent. In such cases, this question can be marked **N/A**, or **No**, since the inconsistency outlined in incorrect. Please use your judgement for the answer to this question for consistent summaries.

#### Payment
For the initial pilot study, you will be paid $35 to evaluate 33 summaries. You will be paid via Upwork once you have completed the pilot. Please allow a few days to submit the payment.
