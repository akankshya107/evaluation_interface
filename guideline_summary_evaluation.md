#### Task Description
In this task, you will be presented with a short story, along with a summary of the story. Please read both the story and the summary carefully. We will first ask you to assess whether the summary is consistent with the story. Once you have made this judgment, we will show you an AI-detected inconsistency between the story and the summary, which **may or may not be correct**. The AI system will also provide an argument for and against the inconsistency. You will be asked to judge whether the AI-generated inconsistency and explanations are plausible. Finally, you will have a chance to change your answer to the fist question if one of the AI-arguments has persuaded you differently.

**Warning:** Some of the stories may contain content that readers could find offensive, disturbing, or otherwise unsettling. If you do not feel comfortable with this, please feel free to decline the task.

If you encounter any problems or have other feedback, please contact columbia.nlp@outlook.com

#### Detailed Instructions with Example
Please read the story carefully and try to understand the points that are central to the plot. 

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

&nbsp;

Below are two example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

**Question 1: Is the information in the summary consistent with the story?**
>The first question asks you to judge whether or not the summary is consistent with the original story. The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details of the story or make things up.

>For example, *Summary A* is consistent with the story. The last bold sentence in *Summary A* contains some commentary on the story, and we ask you to ignore commentary in evaluating consistency.

>*Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story as the minister was sitting in the puddle of water instead of lying in it.

**Possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in summary A**
>Inconsistency: The rainwater has been collecting into pools in the hospital courtyard. 

>Reason for inconsistency: The story describes pools of water in the courtyard. However, it does not specify that these pools of water are from rainwater. Thus, the summary is inconsistent in this detail with respect to the story.

>Reason for consistency: The story mentions the pools of water in the courtyard. It also details that it is raining hard, which is clearly the source of the pools of water.

**Possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in summary B**
>Inconsistency: One of the ministers is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

>Reason for inconsistency: The story states that the minister who was too weak to stand was sitting down in the puddle of water with his head on his knees versus lying in it. Thus, the summary is inconsistent in this detail with respect to the story.

>Reason for consistency: Whether the minister was lying down or sitting, the meaning is not significantly different.

**Question 2: Are the AI-generated possible inconsistency and its arguments for and against plausible?**
>The information in the *possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in the summary* can contain a correct analysis of the summary with respect to the story, or contain an incorrect, or invented inconsistency. This question asks you to judge whether this AI-generated inconsistency and its arguments are *plausible*, not which argument you agree with.

>For example, the *Summary A* arguments are not plausible becauuse the summary does not specify that the pools are from rainwater.

>Whereas, the *Summary B* arguments are plausible. Even if you agree with the "reason for consistency" in the summary B argument, you would still mark this as plausible as both explanations make sense and the inconsistency identified is a difference between the summary and the story.

**Question 3 (repeated): Is the information in the summary consistent with the story?**\
>If the AI-generated inconsistency changes your answer to the first question (for example, identifying some inconsistency that you may have missed), account for the change here. Do not change your first answer.

#### Payment
For the initial pilot study, you will be paid $35 to evaluate 33 summaries. You will be paid via Upwork once you have completed the pilot. Please allow a few days to submit the payment. 

**Thank you so much for participating in our study!! We would love to hear any feedback that you may have about this task!**
