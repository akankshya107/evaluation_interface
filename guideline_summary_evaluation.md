#### Detailed Instructions with Example
Please read the story carefully and try to understand the points that are central to the plot. 

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

&nbsp;

Below are two example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

**Question 1: Is the information in the summary consistent with the story?**
>The first question asks you to judge whether or not the summary is consistent with the original story. The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details of the story or make things up.

>For example, *Summary A* is consistent with the story. The last bold sentence in *Summary A* contains some commentary on the story, and we ask you to ignore commentary in evaluating consistency. The response would ideally be "Yes" for *Summary A*.

>*Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story as the minister was sitting in the puddle of water instead of lying in it.  The response would ideally be "No" for *Summary B*.

**The followup question will be different according to your response to Question 1.**

**Question 2 (for Summary A): List the key details of the summary that verify that the summary is consistent with the story.**

>Include the consistent details between the summary and the story which prompted you to select "Yes" for Question 1. For this summary, a possible response is:

>The summary includes the key details of the execution of six cabinet ministers, the early morning (6:30 AM), and the heavy rain. The story mentions these details in the first few sentences. 
>Further, the summary includes the key details of the minister sick with typhoid and how he was sitting on his knees when shot. All the details described in the summary are mentioned in the actual story.

**Question 2 (for Summary B): List the top inconsistent details that shows that the summary is inconsistent with the story.**

>Include the inconsistent details which prompted you to select "No" for Question 1. These would be details in the summary that are not mentioned in the actual story, or are a contradiction to what occurred, or a misinterpretation of the events of the story. For this summary, a possible response is:

>The story states that the minister who was too weak to stand was sitting down in the puddle of water with his head on his knees versus lying in a puddle of water. This is an inconsistent detail in the summary with respect to the story.

#### Payment
