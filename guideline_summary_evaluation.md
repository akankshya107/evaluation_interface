### Detailed Instructions with Example

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

Below are two example summaries for this story:\
**Summary A**
>The short story describes the execution of six cabinet ministers by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is brought downstairs and shot while sitting in a puddle of water with his head on his knees. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

**Summary B**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

##### Question 1: List the key details of the summary.

Write the key details of the summary *in your own words*. For summary A, a possible response is:

* The summary includes the key details of the execution of six cabinet ministers in the early morning and the heavy rain.
* The summary includes the key details of the minister sick with typhoid and how he was sitting on his knees when shot.
* The summary talks about the image of human suffering painted by the story.

For summary B, a possible response is:

* The summary includes the key details of the execution of six cabinet ministers in the early morning during heavy rain.
* The summary includes the key details of the minister sick with typhoid and how he was too weak to stand.
* The summary talks about the minister lying in a puddle of water when shot.

##### Question 2: Is the information in the summary consistent with the story?

This question asks you to judge whether or not the summary is consistent with the original story. The events and details described in the summary should not misrepresent details from the story or include details that are unsupported by the story.

For example, *Summary A* is consistent with the story. The last bold sentence in *Summary A* contains some commentary on the story, and we ask you to ignore commentary in evaluating consistency. The response would be "Yes" for *Summary A*.

*Summary B* is **not** consistent with the story as the minister was sitting in the puddle of water instead of lying in it. The response would be "No" for *Summary B*.

### Payment
For the initial pilot study, you will be paid $35 to evaluate 33 summaries. You will be paid via Upwork once you have completed the pilot. Please allow a few days to submit the payment.
