#### Task Description
In this task, you will be presented with a short story, along with a summary of the story. Please read both the story and the summary carefully. We will also include some AI-generated inconsistencies of the summary with respect to the story, which may or may not be correct. We will then ask you to evaluate if this generated inconsistency is correct, or if it is incorrect. Finally, you will be asked to assess whether the summary is consistent with the story. 

**Warning:** Some of the stories may contain content that readers could find offensive, disturbing, or otherwise unsettling. If you do not feel comfortable with this, please feel free to decline the task.

If you encounter any problems or have other feedback, please contact columbia.nlp@outlook.com

#### Detailed Instructions with Example
Please read the story carefully and try to understand the points that are central to the plot. 

**Story**
>They shot the six cabinet ministers at half-past six in the morning against the wall of a hospital. There were pools of water in the courtyard. There were wet dead leaves on the paving of the courtyard. It rained hard. All the shutters of the hospital were nailed shut. One of the ministers was sick with typhoid. Two soldiers carried him downstairs and out into the rain. They tried to hold him up against the wall but he sat down in a puddle of water. The other five stood very quietly against the wall. Finally, the officer told the soldiers it was no good trying to make him stand up. When they fired the first volley he was sitting down in the water with his head on his knees.

&nbsp;

Two example summaries for this story:

**Summary A**
>Six cabinet ministers are executed by firing squad early in the morning during heavy rain. One of the ministers is sick with typhoid fever and too weak to stand, so he is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

**Summary B**
>The rain has been pouring heavily, which has led to the hospital shutters being nailed shut. The rainwater has been collecting into pools in the hospital courtyard. The execution of six cabinet ministers is carried out by firing squad early in the morning. **The story paints a vivid image of human suffering.**

&nbsp;

In addition to the story and the summary, there will be AI-generated inconsistencies in the summary, with respect to the story. This would be provided for every story and summary and would contain at least one detected inconsistent detail identified between the summary and the story.

#### Questions
##### Question: Evaluate the AI-generated inconsistency.

The information in the *possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in the summary* can contain a correct detected inconsistency in the summary with respect to the story, or contain an incorrect, or invented inconsistency. This question asks you to judge whether this AI-generated inconsistency is correct. You can choose to provide an argument for and against the inconsistency.

Please remember that an inconsistency between the summary and the story is detected. If you answer "Provide an argument that this detected inconsistency is correct.", you are justifying the detected inconsistency. If you answer "Provide an argument that this detected inconsistency is incorrect.", you are writing a proof against the detected inconsistency.

**Possible AI-generated inconsistency detected in summary A**
>Inconsistency: One of the ministers ... is shot while **lying in a puddle of water** near the hospital wall.

For this, you may choose to answer: "Provide an argument that this detected inconsistency is correct."
>The story states that the minister who was too weak to stand was sitting down in the puddle of water with his head on his knees versus lying in it. Thus, the summary is inconsistent in this detail with respect to the story.

Or, you may choose to answer: "Provide an argument that this detected inconsistency is incorrect."
>The summary talks about the minister lying in a puddle of water. The story also mentions a sick minister who is in a puddle of water when the first shots are fired.

**Possible AI-generated inconsistency identified in summary B**
>Inconsistency: The rainwater has been collecting into pools in the hospital courtyard. 

For this, you may choose to answer: "Provide an argument that this detected inconsistency is correct."
>The story describes pools of water in the courtyard. However, it does not specify that these pools of water are from rainwater. Thus, the summary is inconsistent in this detail with respect to the story.

Or, you may choose to answer: "Provide an argument that this detected inconsistency is incorrect."
>The story mentions the pools of water in the courtyard. It also details that it is raining hard, which is clearly the source of the pools of water. This is a misinterpretation of the facts in the story.

##### Question: Overall, is the information in the summary consistent with the story?

This question asks you to judge whether or not the summary is consistent with the original story. In this case, you want to make sure the events and details described in the summary are mentioned in the actual story. 

For example, *Summary A* is **not** consistent with the story as the minister was sitting in the puddle of water and not lying in it. 

*Summary B* is consistent with the story. The last bold sentence in *Summary B* contains some commentary on the story, and we ask you to ignore commentary in evaluating consistency. 

#### Payment
For the initial pilot study, you will be paid $35 to evaluate 33 summaries. You will be paid via Upwork once you have completed the pilot. Please allow a few days to submit the payment. 

**Thank you so much for participating in our study!! We would love to hear any feedback that you may have about this task!**
